                    <p>
                        Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant,
                        focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration
                        from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they
                        rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate
                        prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.
                    </p>

                        Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the
                        United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu,
                        Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all
                        the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic
                        Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
